## Descriptions

- Offered by: MIT
- Prerequisites: None
- Programming Languages: Python
- Difficulty: ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ
- Class Hour: 40 hours

This course, introduced as part of MIT's curriculum reform in 2022, serves as the introductory programming course for the [6-3](https://www.eecs.mit.edu/academics/undergraduate-programs/curriculum/6-3-computer-science-and-engineering/) (Computer Science and Engineering), [6-4](https://www.eecs.mit.edu/academics/undergraduate-programs/curriculum/6-4-artificial-intelligence-and-decision-making/) (Artificial Intelligence and Decision Making), and [6-5](https://www.eecs.mit.edu/academics/undergraduate-programs/curriculum/6-5-electrical-engineering-with-computing/) (Electrical Engineering with Computing) programs. The course covers all content from 6.100A (one of the two mandatory courses for MIT's EECS department).

The instructor, Ana Bell, has been a lecturer in the EECS department for nearly a decade (as of 2022). The course topics include concepts of computation, the Python programming language, basic algorithms and data structures, testing and debugging, and algorithmic complexity.

The course consists of 26 lectures with ample in-class and post-class exercises, all of which include solutions (except for Problem Sets). The course and its assignments are well-paced, and all materials are freely available online. It provides a structured introduction to the world of computer science. To follow along effectively, download the course code in advance and work through it alongside the lectures.
